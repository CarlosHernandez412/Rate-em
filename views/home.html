        <h6>Rate 'Em is a locally created real estate software focused on creating
          a better user experience between tenants and landlords and ease the stress
          of being a renter or renting out your home. Users can decide if they would
          like to create an account as a landlord or a tenant on the site.
          The rating system is utilized for the benefit of other users on making
          an informed decision.</h6>
    
        <h6>Our application is primarily set to allow users to search by city/state/zipcode
          of the area that they are looking to stay, property requirements that they are
          looking for, or they can directly search by a landlord, and in result get the
          landlord's information, rating, and any reviews left by tenants that have rented a
          property to before so that other people looking to rent can read reviews on the
          landlord rather than just the property itself. Alternatively, landlords can also
          leave reviews but on their renters so other landlords can be aware of who they
          are renting their property out to. Anyone can visit the site and read reviews,
          but users can create an account as a landlord or renter to share their thoughts.
          In conclusion, the goal for Rate 'Em is to assure properties are in good hands
          and well managed so renting can go smoothly as possible.</p>
    
          <h6>Our review and rating system is designed to support both renters and landlords.
            Landlords and renters will both be able to know who their tenants are and have an idea
            of what to expect from each other. Landlords are almost universally expected to run background
            checks and review a tenant's credit as part of the procedure, however only 37.6% always check
            a tenant's criminal background and 38.7% check credit history [1]. These checks should be done anyway,
            but shared reviews can help landlords have a better idea of who their renters are. Tenants, on the
            other hand, can read landlord reviews to see how fair a landlord is based on previous tenants' experiences
            with that landlord, because 48.7% of landlords have asked tenants to leave suddenly or have raised
            their monthly rent on occasion [1].
