# Rate 'Em

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="./images/myicon.png" alt="Logo"></p>

Rate 'Em is an online web application for landlords and tenants to leave honest reviews about each other and for anyone to be able to view those reviews. It is based on the idea of Airbnb and Rate My Professor.  
Our application is primarily set to allow users to search by city/state/zipcode of the area that they are looking to stay, and possibly rent long-term, or directly search by a landlord, and in result get the landlordâ€™s information, rating, and any reviews left by tenants that have rented a property from before so that other people looking to rent can read reviews on the landlord rather than just the property itself. Alternatively, landlords can also leave reviews but on their renters so other landlords can be aware of who they are renting their property out to. Anyone can visit the site and read reviews, but users can create an account as a landlord or renter to share their thoughts. In conclusion, the goal for Rate 'Em is to assure properties are in good hands and well managed so renting can go smoothly as possible.
