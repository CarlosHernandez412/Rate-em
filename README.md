<h1 style="color: #236c93;">What is Rate 'Em?</h1>
Rate 'Em is a locally created real estate software focused on creating a better user experience between tenants and landlords and ease the stress of being a renter or renting out your home. Users can decide if they would like to create an account as a landlord or a tenant on the site. The rating system is utilized for the benefit of other users on making an informed decision.
</br>
Our application is primarily set to allow users to search by zipcode of the area that they are looking to stay, filter by property type that they are looking for, or they can directly search for a landlord by name, and in result get the landlord's information, rating, and any reviews left by other registered users so that anyone looking to rent can read reviews on the landlord rather than just the property itself. Alternatively, landlords can also leave reviews but on renters so other people can be aware of who they are renting their property out to. Anyone can visit the site and read reviews, but users must create an account as a landlord or renter to share their thoughts. In conclusion, the goal for Rate 'Em is to assure properties are in good hands and well managed so renting can go smoothly as possible.

Our review and rating system is designed to support both renters and landlords. Landlords and renters will both be able to know who their tenants are and have an idea of what to expect from each other. Landlords are almost universally expected to run background checks and review a tenant's credit as part of the procedure, however only 37.6% always check a tenant's criminal background and 38.7% check credit history <a href="https://getflex.com/blog/landlord-statistics/">[1]</a>. These checks should be done anyway,but shared reviews can help landlords have a better idea of who their renters are. Tenants, on the other hand, can read landlord reviews to see how fair a landlord is based on previous tenants' experiences with that landlord, because 48.7% of landlords have asked tenants to leave suddenly or have raised their monthly rent on occasion <a href="https://getflex.com/blog/landlord-statistics/">[1]</a>.

<h1 style="color: #236c93;">Registered Users</h1>
Registered users will have a profile containing their information, property list (landlord account), rental history (tenant account), a rating, and a review section where other registered users can leave comments. At any point, a registered user can update their account information or delete their account, however; each time an update occurs or whenever the account owner decides to terminate their account, they are required to enter their password. If the password is incorrect, then no change occurs.
</br>
The “My Rental” page is available only to tenant accounts where they will be able to view their rental history once it is available when a landlord account lists them, and the tenant has the ability to give their rental experience a rating out of five and update it further on. The tenant user will always be required to enter their password each time they give or update a rating.
</br>
The “My Properties” page is an available page for Landlord accounts. They have the additional settings option to add new properties, update their property information, or possibly delete a listed property. They are also able to add, update, and delete a tenant that has rented or is currently renting from them. In the event of the renter table being altered on the landlord side, will affect the tenant’s table in the “My Rental” page. As always, landlords are required to enter their password to make changes.

<h1 style="color: #236c93;">Future Plans</h1>
We aim to keep extending the search feature so that users may filter searches by account type and property information such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and even rental price. For the ratings feature, we would want to improve the UI design as an interactive star rating option instead and add a detailed overall rating page for accounts that will show their total rating in depth by stars, as well as their best rated comment that was considered useful. We also want to change the comment section's policy such that they are only allowed between renters and landlords. We intend to limit comments on the landlord's profile to tenants who have previously rented from them so that other potential renters may view the feedback. Landlords may also leave feedback on their renter's profile so that other landlords can be aware of who they are renting their property out to. In addition to the comment's functionality, we want to allow any registered user to respond to any other registered user's comment.
</br>
The most essential feature we have considered is a direct messaging system that would allow users to communicate privately and safely with one another without sharing contact information on their accounts or commenting on one another's profiles. This could imply extending the user settings to allow users to choose whether or not to hide their contact information, and possibly add more such as allowing for profile pictures. The addition to images would then lead to users being able to submit photos or videos alongside their comments.
